The *EboxMessage* is a legacy e-Box web service for Document Senders to publish with SOAP requests.
The REST integration is the new and privileged way but we keep the SOAP specifications available on this page.

## Technical specifications of the publication web service
- [EBoxMessage - Specification Guide](/openapi/SOAP/EBoxMessage_SpecificationGuide.pdf)

## Publication web service (WSDL-XSD)
- [EboxMessage WSDL-XSD](/openapi/SOAP/EboxMessage_WSDL-XSD.zip)

## Usefull links
- [How to sign a SOAP message with a x509 certificate](https://www.socialsecurity.be/site_fr/general/helpcentre/soa/security_ws_x509.htm).
Pay attention that not all the pages on that website are true for the case of e-Box web services.
- [How to generate a P12 or JKS keystore](https://www.socialsecurity.be/site_fr/general/helpcentre/soa/developer_create_keystore.htm)

If you received an error message after an attempt to send a publication request, perhaps an explanation of the error is on the [EBoxMessage troubleshooting page](../ds/troubleshooting_SOAP.md).
